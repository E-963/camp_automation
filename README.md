## Campus Online Automation System as a 3-Tier Web Application on AWS
 #### Project Overview:
The Campus Online Automation System is designed to streamline interaction between students, college placement faculty, and companies visiting the campus. The system will be deployed on AWS Cloud to leverage its high availability, scalability, and security features, ensuring seamless operations for all stakeholders.

This document outlines how to deploy the system manually using AWS services with step-by-step instructions, focusing on the following:

High Availability: Ensuring the system remains operational even in the case of failures.
Scalability: Ability to handle increasing loads by scaling resources up or down.
Security: Securing the application, data, and access to meet modern security standards.
The infrastructure will be manually created through the AWS Management Console to achieve these goals.
